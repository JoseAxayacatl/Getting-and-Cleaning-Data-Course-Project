The Cleaning_data_smatphone.R file contains the code to performs all the steps required to complete the assignament of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project from Coursera.org
the code has the following steps:

First step. 
Download the dataset and set the working directory under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Second and third steps. 
First I created 3 objects: activity (10299 rows, 1 column), subject (10299 rows, 1 column) and features (10299 rows, 561 columns).
In each object I load the train and test file and merge both files with rbind() funtion: 
for activity object, the Y_test.txt and Y_train.text files,
for subject object, the subject_test.txt and subject_train.text files,
finally, for the features object, the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files.


Fourth step.
I created a data frame called all.data wich contains the activity, subject and features objects.
This data frame has 10299 rows and 563 columns, and rename the columns with the features.txt file.

Then, I created a  new object called select.data, which contains only the columns from all.data object wich contains "mean" and "std" in the column name
this object has 10299 rows and 68 columns

Sixth step.
I rename the values from activity column in the followin way:

1  to  WALKING
2  to  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3  to  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4  to  SITTING
5  to  STANDING
6  to  LAYING


Then, i rename the labels of the data set in the followin way:
the columns wich contain... change to ...
"t"   to  time
"f"   to  frequency
"Acc" to  Accelerometer
"Gyro" to Gyroscope
"Mag" to  Magnitude
"BodyBody" to Body

Seventh step.
I calculate the mean for each subject for each activity and ordered the values for subject and activity
I saved this valuesin a new object called tidy.data (180 rows, 68 columns).

Finally I created a txt file called "tidydata.txt" wich contain the data frame tidy.data
